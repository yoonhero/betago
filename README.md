# Is it Q*?

There are many rumours about Q* algorithm. 
One thing we can suppose to about this algorithm is naming. 
This project is about implementing the Gomuku, easier than Go, with various traditional path finding algorithms for best decision making based on game theory.


## Method

I use ResNet based U-Net architecture for predicting policy distribution and value, just as alphago. But I exploit the unet's image transforming ability for predicting policy job.
